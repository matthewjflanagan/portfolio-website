    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Full-stack web developer leveraging sales background to build a more user-friendly experience on the web. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from Georgia Tech University, with newly developed skills in creating responsive web designs. Critical thinker, problem solver, communicative, and analytical  passionate about creating a user-friendly experience both with the interface a user sees and the functionality of tools in the app. During my time as an Account Executive I was awarded Rookie of the Year in Sales for my company and my branch’s yearly profits are estimated on pace to increase 800% since I joined in August of 2019. The efficiencies gained through user-friendly tools meant to enhance productivity are applicable to nearly every industry. I’m excited to leverage the insights I have gained in sales with the knowledge from the full-stack web development course to allow the internet to be more accessible to businesses and their customers.
